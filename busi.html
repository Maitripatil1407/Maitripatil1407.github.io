    <h1>Sustainable Development Goals</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Solar Power Irrigation Scheduling</h2>
    <h3>SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</h3>
    <p><strong>Target 6.3:</strong> By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indicator 6.3.2:</strong> Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Indicator 6.3.1:</strong> Proportion of wastewater safely treated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy</h3>
    <p><strong>Target 7.2:</strong> By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indicator 7.2.1:</strong> Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption.</li>
        <li><strong>Indicator 7.2.2:</strong> Renewable energy share in the total electricity generation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SDG 13: Climate Action</h3>
    <p><strong>Target 13.1:</strong> Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indicator 13.1.1:</strong> Number of deaths, missing persons, and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Focus:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhance the efficiency and sustainability of water use in agriculture.</li>
        <li>Increase the utilization of renewable energy sources in agricultural practices.</li>
        <li>Improve resilience to climate-related hazards through sustainable agricultural practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Energy Generation Tracking</h2>

    <p><strong>Target 7.1:</strong> By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indicator 7.1.1:</strong> Proportion of population with access to electricity.</li>
        <li><strong>Indicator 7.1.2:</strong> Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SDG 13: Climate Action</h3>
    <p><strong>Target 13.2:</strong> Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indicator 13.2.1:</strong> Number of countries with nationally determined contributions, long-term strategies, national adaptation plans, strategies as reported in adaptation communications and national communications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Focus:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Monitor and enhance the efficiency of energy generation from renewable sources.</li>
